**Goal:** Develop an automated system that processes a scientific paper and computes readability statistics, uses an LLM to generate a paper summary and podcast conversation script. Use the script to generate a podcast using TTS.

**Additional Research Questions:**
- **Readability vs. citation count** – Do more readable papers get cited more? 
Correlation analysis b/w readability scores & citation count
Hypothesis Testing? Compare readability of highly cited vs. low-cited papers (t-test?) 
- **Number of equations vs. readability** – Does more math lower readability?
Scatter plots of equation count vs. readability scores?
Regression Analysis? Predict readability using number of equations as a feature
- **Readability trends over time** – Are scientific papers becoming harder/easier to read?
Line graphs of readability scores over years?
Moving averages?
- **Collaboration Rates Across Disciplines** – Is there a significant difference in collaboration rates across disciplines? 
Hypothesis Testing ANOVA?
Degree distribution of number of authors across disciplines
